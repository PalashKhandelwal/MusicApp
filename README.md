# MusicApp

This is a simple music app designed to make your music listening experience more enjoyable.
When you launch the app, it will request permission to access your device's external storage to read and organize your audio files.
Once you grant permission, the app will display your music files in an easy-to-navigate list view.
You can then select any track you'd like to listen to.
With a single tap, you can start listening to your chosen song in the next layout.
In the next layout, you'll find the current song displayed prominently.
You can easily control your music, with options to play, pause, and skip to the previous or next songs.
It's all about the love for music and a user-friendly experience.
